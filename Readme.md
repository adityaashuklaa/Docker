# Learning Docker

> This is the repo i have created for my own learning, which cover the concepts of docker and notes along with it. 

## Steping stone to Kubernetes
-- If you want to run processes in isolated environments, Docker(Containers) let you do so! 
-- The benefit of using docker is that the isolated environments cannot talk to eachother and independent.
-- If you have one isolated environment you can run 10 different applications on them.
-- Starting projects locally/ auxillary services locally.
-- Auxilary Services => Postgress

## Containerization
-- A container is an enviroment, or mini machine working on your main machine. 
-- Container is a way to package and distribute software applications in a way that makes them easy to deploy and run consistently across different environments.
